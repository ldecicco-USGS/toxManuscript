Figure SI-1. Location of water sampling locations, watershed boundaries, and watershed land-uses. Map IDs are defined in Table SI-1.
Figure SI-2. Exposure activity ratios (EAR) using ToxCast endpoints and the detection level of chemicals monitored in Great Lakes tributaries, 2010-2013.
Figure SI-3. Maximum exposure activity ratios (EARmaxChem) for monitored chemicals at each of 57 Great Lakes tributaries, 2010-2013.
Figure SI-4. Number of sites where the exposure acivity ratios (EARmaxChem) for individual chemicals exceeded 0.001. Chemicals in red indicate those that were present at a minimum of 10 sites and had EARmaxChem > 10-3 at a minimum of 5 sites.

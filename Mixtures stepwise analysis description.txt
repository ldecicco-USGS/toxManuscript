Choosing priority chemicals

1. Join EAR data with AOP relevance information
2. Remove AOPs that are not relevant
3. Filter by max EAR per chemical per endpoint
4. sum EARs by sample and AOP (EARsumAOP)
5. Retain only samples with EARsumAOP > 10^-3
6. Remove chemicals in each sample that do not contribute at least 1% of EARsumAOP
7. Retain only chemicals that show up at a minimum of 5 sites


Mixtures analysis
1. Join EAR data with AOP relevance information
2. Remove AOPs that are not relevant
3. Filter by max EAR per chemical per endpoint
4. sum EARs by sample and AOP (EARsumAOP)
5. Retain only samples with EARsumAOP > 10^-3
6. Take note of which samples remain
7. Go back to original data set and subset only chemicals that result from step 6
8. Subset to "priority chemicals" defined above.
9. Remove individual instances of EAR < 0.00001 (this is < 1% of potential influence in individual EARsumAOP values) and it makes the resulting data set more manageable for mixture analysis
10. Determine how many sites that 2-, 3-, and 4-chemical combinations occur at.
11. Examine EARsumAOPs for resulting data
